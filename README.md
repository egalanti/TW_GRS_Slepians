This code calculates the gravity signal of the Jupiter GRS, based on observed winds and a thermal wind ballance. It also reconstract the signal using a singal Slepian function
It produces Figure S4 from our manuscript.

It runs on MacOS environement.

To run the code unzip the file, go into the folder TW_GRS_executable, and run:

./run_calc_TW_slepians_MW.sh /Applications/MATLAB_R2021a.app
